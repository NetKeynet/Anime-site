        <h2>My Story with Anime</h2>
        <p>Hi There, I'm Keyrane.</p>
        <p>In the previous series of my life, I didn’t used to be an anime girl.
          HUGE statement compared to how Anime is such a big part of my life now!
        </p>
        <p>Coming to Canada was one BIG experience and school wasn’t so great in Quebec.
          Before I knew it, I had lost my smile and hype energy.
        </p>
        <p>THAT WHEN IT HAPPENED…. </p>
        <p>I watched my first anime ever!
          FARY TAIL. It’s worked wonders on my spirit, weaving a tapestry of emotions that casted away shadows of sadness and brought forth the light of excitement.
        </p>
        <p>I realized that watching anime brings me immense satisfaction.The joy, sadness, rage, and excitement I experience when watching anime are unlike any other. Moreover, it has taught me valuable lessons about the world and people.
          Today, some of my life decisions are inspired by powerful quotes I remember from all the amazing anime I’ve watched.

Throughout the anime, he investigates the death of his mother in such an intense way. Aqua believes that he is a fundamentally bad person and that he does not deserve to be happy. Because of that, he dirties his hands, doing bad and shitty things that hurt the people around him because, to him, it\'s better than letting these \'good\' people who mistakenly have come to care for him dirty themselves in turn.');">

          <h1>Yamori from Tokyo ghoul</h1>
          <p>
            Tokyo Ghoul is a horror-style action seinen anime where fans know they're in for a rough time. Even so, fans despise the thuggish villain Yamori, who styles himself like Jason and even wears a scary hockey mask to mimic the famous Friday the 13th killer. Yamori, even compared to other ghouls, is nasty and brutal. He tortured Ken Kaneki for days on end, and he even lied to Ken to lure the boy into his torture chamber. Finally, Ken broke free and fought back, killing Yamori and cannibalizing him to get stronger.

          <p>
            The royal family of the Melromarc kingdom in the isekai realm in The Rising of the Shield Hero is a mixed bag. The queen is a noble, wise, and benevolent woman who became one of Naofumi Iwatani's best allies, and her young daughter Melty was fairly helpful, too. However, the queen's husband and older daughter are a different story. princess Malty conspired to have Naofumi banished from the kingdom, and Malty used horrible lies and accusations to have Naofumi's name rejected for all time. She didn't regret it at all, and this put her at odds with her mother, the queen. Worse yet, sabotaging Naofumi like that weakened the kingdom's defenses against the Waves. </p>

            Shallow and totally in love with Sasuke are the defining characteristics of Sakura. She breaks off her friendship with Ino over Sasuke, and she’s next to useless in important fights, like the ones against powerhouses like Kaguya and Obito. Her hatred towards Naruto exists only because it has to, but in her defense, Sasuke did a lot worse than her. But despite this, Sakura has fewer people defending her. Still, it's clear that she's one of the most hated characters in Naruto. </p>

            If it weren't for just two key factors, Gabi Braun, the warrior candidate, would actually be fairly admirable and somewhat sympathetic as a character, but this brash, gung-ho young soldier went too far in the eyes of Attack on Titan fans. She can't be easily forgiven for what she's done. It was Gabi who snuck aboard the airship and shot the beloved Sasha Braus, an act that instantly united the entire fandom against her. On top of that, Gabi is reviled for her brainwashed attitude about her fellow Eldians, stubbornly believing them to be devils who must be punished or slaughtered. </p>
